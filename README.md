# C-Gym-and-Nutrition üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•ó

## Fitness Plan Application

## üìù Description

This personal project application was developed as a final project for the "C++ programming for science" course. It's designed to create customized workout and nutrition plans based on user-specific characteristics.
The application runs entirely in the terminal, providing a straightforward and efficient user interface.

## Project Structure

- Notice that there are other text files .txt that serves as "database" structure to store user information
- This project has 2 classes: Nutrition and Workout

### üöÄ Key Features

- **User Account Creation**: Personalized accounts with individual characteristics
- **Customized Plans**: Generates workout and nutrition plans tailored to user profiles
- **Exercise Categories**: Chest, Arms, Legs, and Back workouts
- **Nutrition Guidance**: BMI calculation and recommended caloric/macro intakes
- **Profile Updates**: Users can modify their information for up-to-date plans
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to submit feedback for improvements



## üõ† How It Works

1. **Login/Sign Up**: 
   - Users can login or create a new account
   - New account details are stored in individual text files

2. **Main Menu Options**:
   - Chest Exercises
   - Arm Exercises
   - Leg Exercises
   - Back Exercises
   - Nutrition Guidance
   - Update Profile
   - Submit Feedback
   - Exit Program

3. **Workout Plans**: 
   - Generates tables with exercise names, intensity, frequency, and duration
   - Provides YouTube links for proper exercise techniques and stretching

4. **Nutrition Guidance**:
   - Calculates BMI
   - Recommends daily caloric and macro intakes

5. **Profile Updates**:
   - Users can modify password, fitness goal, age, height, and weight

6. **Feedback Submission**:
   - User feedback stored in 'feedback.txt' for review and improvements

## üí° Technical Notes

- User information stored in individual text files
- Nutritional data sourced from healthline.com
- Workout data based on personal experience and FITT principle

## üîí Security Considerations

Current storage method exposes user information. Future improvements could include:
- Encrypted storage
- Consolidated user data file
  

## üôè Acknowledgements

- Nutritional data: healthline.com
- Workout plans: Based on personal experience and YouTube fitness content

## üíª Why Terminal-Only?

You might be wondering why this fitness app runs exclusively in the terminal. Here's the backstory:

At the time of development, my expertise was primarily in C++ and command-line interfaces. Web development and GUI creation were skills I had yet to acquire. As a result, I embraced the efficiency and simplicity of a terminal-based application.

This approach offered several advantages:
1. **Focus on Functionality**: It allowed me to concentrate on the core features and algorithms without the complexities of UI design.
2. **Rapid Development**: The terminal interface enabled faster prototyping and iteration.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: The app runs with minimal system resources, making it accessible on various devices.
4. **Learning Experience**: It provided an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of C++ and file I/O operations.

While it may lack the visual appeal of a modern GUI, this terminal-based design emphasizes functionality and demonstrates fundamental programming skills. It's a testament to the principle that effective software doesn't always need a flashy interface to provide value.

Future versions may incorporate a more user-friendly interface as my skill set expands. For now, consider it a nod to the classic command-line tools that have been the backbone of computing for decades!
